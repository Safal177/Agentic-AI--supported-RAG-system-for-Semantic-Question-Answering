# Agentic-AI--supported-RAG-system-for-Semantic-Question-Answering

# Project Name:
End to End Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system with Agentic AI and Prompt Engineering

# Project Overview:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) uses current AI systems to reflect pdf document related answers. In this project, I have shown a RAG workflow generated in Google Colab. This pipeline includes loaded pdf papers, chunks form papers, embedded them into embedding model, similarity search, generated answers associated with papers using LLM. This workflow takes Agentic AI environment where it is automated with LLM. This project clearly reflects my skills in RAG pipelines, text embeddings, LangChain, similarity search, LLM inference, and Agentic system pipeline. 

# Technical Components:
•	Google Colab (Python),
•	OpenAI API, 
•	pymupdf,  
•	langchain retrieval stores
•	Agent-oriented AI methods
•	Prompt Engineering
•	LLM query optimization

# Target:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system performs well when I consider the following keys.
•	Load the pdf documents
•	Create chunks for retrieval
•	Make embeddings for similar lookup.
•	Find best k retrieval to get acceptable text.
•	Give relevant text into prompt to get expected result from LLM
•	Use RAG to get reliable results
•	Focus AI with agent-oriented architecture
•	Highlight agent-based AI actions

# Key Features:
•	Load 4 pdf papers in Google Colab and pull-out text using ‘pymupdf,
•	Tokenize each paper into chunks,
•	Use OpenAI Embeddings, LangChain’s data vector store, and then do Semantic search
•	Make semantic retrieval pipeline
•	Create well structured prompt for prompt engineering. 
•	System reflecting Agentic AI workflow
•	Design RAG pipeline for questions and answering. 

# Outcomes:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is completely designed using LLM tools. System connects a list of items such as pdf documents, contextual embeddings, structured prompting, context-aware search, structured prompting, and Agent-focused decision logic. Google colab notebook covers some key items such as AI engineer roles, deep learning engineer responsibilities, text processing engineering, LLM engineering, self-oriented AI pipeline design, combines document ingestion, embeddings, semantic search, prompt engineering, and agentic reasoning, Auto-executed document matching systems, resulting in highly accurate, context-grounded answers, and Knowledge management systems.
